* Started with Paul Irish's HTML5 boilerplate
  http://html5boilerplate.com/

* Pretty much everything is CSS, there are very few images
** Using CSS3 PIE to get some box-shadow/border-radius sweetness for IE
** Uses modernizer to provide fallbacks for IE, where necessary

* I'm using two presentational (non-semantic) hacks
  Search for "Î±" to find them.

* There's some javascript at the bottom that was written for testing
  you'll probably want to pull that out.
