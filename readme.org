* Drumbeat.org Redesign
** Started with Paul Irish's HTML5 boilerplate
  http://html5boilerplate.com/

** Pretty much everything is CSS, there are very few images
   - CSS3 PIE to get some box-shadow/border-radius sweetness for IE
   - modernizer to provide fallbacks for IE, where necessary

** I'm using two presentational (non-semantic) hacks
   Search for "Î±" to find them.

** There's some javascript at the bottom that was written for testing
   you'll probably want to pull that out.
